# Trail-Runner
Trail Runner is a mini-game written in E2 that can be hosted on a Sandbox server.  (Requirement: E2Power Availability)

 The essence of the game: to gain as much speed as possible than the others using two paths - eating bubbles (two zones), to expect the addition of one speed in the interval of 2 seconds.

 Map: gm_construct.

 It has the functions:
 - Saving player accounts.
 - Chat teams. (/reset - reset the speed; /spawn - teleport to respawn; /speed - find out your own speed; /drop N - throw a bubble from the Nth speed in the interval: 200 - 500; /time - find out how long the mini-chip costs  games, for reliability)
 - Purchase trails (tails).
 - Display of TOP players.
 - Beautiful rendering of nicknames.
